### How to Find the Most Popular Query Strings?

#### Problem Description
A search engine logs every query string used by users, with each string being no more than 255 bytes in length.

Suppose there are currently 10 million records (with high redundancy, meaning there are no more than 3 million unique query strings out of the 10 million). The task is to find the top 10 most popular query strings, using no more than 1GB of memory. (The higher the redundancy of a query string, the more users are searching for it, making it more popular.)

#### Solution Approach
Given that each query string can be up to 255B, the 10 million strings would require about 2.55GB of memory, making it impossible to load all strings into memory for processing.

**Method 1: Divide and Conquer**
Divide and conquer is a very practical method here.

- Split the data into multiple smaller files, ensuring each small file's strings can be loaded into memory for processing.
- Find the top 10 most frequent strings in each file.
- Use a min-heap to find the top 10 most frequent strings across all files.

This method is feasible but not the best, so let's explore other methods.

**Method 2: HashMap Method**
Despite the large total number of strings, there are no more than 3 million unique strings. Therefore, consider storing all strings and their frequencies in a HashMap. The required space is approximately 300w*(255+4)â‰ˆ777M (where 4 represents the 4 bytes occupied by an integer). Hence, 1GB of memory is sufficient.

**Approach:**

1. Traverse the strings:
   - If a string is not in the map, add it with a value of 1.
   - If a string is in the map, increment its value by 1.
   - This step has a time complexity of O(N).

2. Traverse the map and build a min-heap of 10 elements:
   - If a string's frequency is higher than the root of the heap, replace the root and adjust the heap to maintain the min-heap property.
   - After traversing, the heap contains the 10 most frequent strings.
   - This step has a time complexity of O(Nlog10).

**Method 3: Trie Method**
Instead of using a HashMap to count frequencies, when strings have many common prefixes, use a trie (prefix tree) to count the frequencies. Each node in the tree holds the string frequency, with 0 indicating no occurrence.

**Approach:**

1. Traverse the strings:
   - Search for each string in the trie.
   - If found, increment the node's frequency by 1.
   - If not found, construct new nodes for the string, setting the leaf node's frequency to 1.

2. Use a min-heap to sort the strings by frequency.

**Summary**
Tries are often used to count string occurrences. They are also useful for string search and checking for duplicate strings.
