## Interview Question

If you were to design a message queue system, how would you approach the architecture design? Share your thought process.

## Interviewer’s Psychological Analysis

When discussing this question, the interviewer generally aims to evaluate two aspects:

- Whether you have a deep understanding of the principles behind a specific message queue system or grasp the overall architecture principles of message queues.
- Assessing your design skills by presenting a common system (in this case, a message queue system) and seeing if you can conceptualize the overall architecture and identify key components.

Honestly, when faced with such questions, many people are caught off guard because they haven’t thought about these issues before. **Most people use these technologies without considering the underlying principles.** Similar questions might include: How would you design the Spring framework? How would you design the Dubbo framework? How would you design the MyBatis framework?

## Question Breakdown

To answer this type of question, you don’t need to have read the source code of the technology. At the very least, you should understand the basic principles, core components, and architecture, and then outline a design based on some open-source technologies.

For a message queue system, consider the following aspects:

- **Scalability**: The message queue should support scalability to quickly expand when needed, increasing throughput and capacity. Design a distributed system, similar to Kafka’s design philosophy: broker -> topic -> partition. Each partition resides on a separate machine and stores a portion of the data. If resources are insufficient, add more partitions to the topic, perform data migration, and increase the number of machines to store more data and provide higher throughput.

- **Data Persistence**: Consider whether the message queue should persist data to disk. It definitely should, to ensure data isn’t lost if a process crashes. How to persist data? Use sequential writes to avoid the overhead of random disk reads and writes. Sequential disk writes are highly performant, which is the approach used by Kafka.

- **Availability**: Think about the availability of your message queue. Refer to Kafka’s high-availability mechanisms: multiple replicas, leader & follower, and leader election in case of broker failure to maintain service availability.

- **Zero Data Loss**: Can the system support zero data loss? Yes, you can refer to Kafka’s zero data loss strategies.

Designing a message queue system is complex. The interviewer is looking to see if you have the ability to think and design from an architectural perspective. This question can filter out a lot of candidates because many people do not typically consider these aspects.
