## Interview Question

How would you design a sharding and partitioning strategy that allows for dynamic scaling (both scaling up and scaling down)?

## Interviewer Psychological Analysis

When dealing with database sharding and partitioning, you need to consider the following:

- Choosing a database middleware, researching, learning, and testing it.
- Designing your sharding and partitioning strategy, such as how many databases and tables you need (e.g., 3 databases with 4 tables each).
- Testing whether the sharding and partitioning setup works for reading and writing in your testing environment.
- Migrating from a single database to a sharded setup using a **dual-write strategy**.
- Transitioning the live system to use the sharded setup.
- Handling the need to scale out (e.g., expanding to 6 databases with 12 tables each).

The question aims to assess whether you have practical experience with the entire process, from setting up sharding and partitioning to scaling the system dynamically.

### Downtime Scaling (Not Recommended)

This method is similar to the downtime migration approach. It involves the following steps:

1. Announce a maintenance window for scaling.
2. At the designated time, stop the system to halt all traffic and data writes.
3. Use a data migration tool to extract data from the existing databases and write it into the new databases and tables.
4. After migration, update the system's configuration and restart it.
5. Verify that the new setup works as expected.

This approach is not ideal for systems with large amounts of data, as downtime can be extensive and problematic.

### Optimized Scaling Strategy

A more advanced approach involves planning for large-scale expansion from the beginning:

1. **Initial Setup**: Start with a configuration of 32 databases, each containing 32 tables, totaling 1024 tables. This configuration is sufficient for most companies.

2. **Data Distribution**: Use a routing strategy where an ID is first hashed to determine the database and then hashed again to determine the table within the selected database.

   Example routing:
   - Calculate `id % 32` to determine the database.
   - Calculate `(id / 32) % 32` to determine the table within the database.

   | orderId | id % 32 (Database) | id / 32 % 32 (Table) |
   | ------- | ------------------ | -------------------- |
   | 259     | 3                  | 8                    |
   | 1189    | 5                  | 5                    |
   | 352     | 0                  | 11                   |
   | 4593    | 17                 | 15                   |

3. **Expansion**: When scaling, you can increase the number of database servers. For example:
   - Start with 32 database servers, each hosting one database.
   - Expand to 64 servers, then 128 servers, and so on, if needed.

4. **Database Migration**: Use database administration tools for migrating databases between servers. This process is typically more efficient than writing custom data migration code.

5. **System Configuration**: Update system configurations to reflect the new database servers. This may involve changing connection settings but not altering routing rules.

6. **Deploy and Test**: Redeploy the system with the new configuration. Ensure that routing rules remain consistent and that the system can handle the increased load.

This strategy minimizes manual intervention and allows for easier scaling and management of database resources.
